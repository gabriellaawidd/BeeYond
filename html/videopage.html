                <p class="video-description">This video presents a clear and structured introduction to the concept of limits,
                    a fundamental idea in calculus that describes the behavior of functions as they approach specific values.
                    Aimed at high school and early university students, the explanation combines intuitive reasoning with graphical
                    representations to build a solid conceptual foundation. You will gain an understanding of one-sided limits,
                    the use of formal limit notation, and how limits serve as a basis for more advanced topics such as continuity and derivatives.
                    This video is designed to support you in developing a deeper appreciation of mathematical reasoning as you begin your study of
                    calculus.</p>
