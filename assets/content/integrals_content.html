    <h2>Chapter 3: Integrals</h2>
    <h3>3.1 The Idea of the Integral</h3>
    <p>This chapter explores the idea and technique of integration. Integration involves adding up infinitely many infinitesimally small things. Calculus provides a better way to perform this addition.  The core problem of integration is finding a limit of sums.  The key concept is working backward from derivatives. If a function v(x) can be recognized as the derivative of another function f(x), then v(x) can be integrated. This f(x) is essentially an "antiderivative."  Numerical integration can still yield an excellent answer even if a suitable f(x) isn't found. </p>

    <p>Integrals and derivatives can largely be explained through sums and differences.  The fundamental idea lies in a basic algebraic fact that, when taken to the limit as n approaches infinity, becomes a core principle of calculus.  This "going to the limit" step is the crucial distinction between algebra and calculus when dealing with infinite infinitesimals.  </p>

    <h3>3.2 Antiderivatives</h3>
    <p>The symbol for the integral was invented by Leibniz and is a stretched-out 'S' from the Latin word for sum.  This symbol serves as a powerful reminder of the entire construction: sums approach integrals, and rectangular areas approach curved areas. </p>

    <p>Rectangles with a base of Δx lead to the integral. The "dx" indicates that Δx approaches zero. The heights of the rectangles are determined by the curve v(x). The sum of v(j) times Δx approaches "the integral of v of x dx," representing an infinitely thin rectangle above every point. </p>

    <p>The core problem of integral calculus is to find this limiting area. We have a symbol for the answer, involving the integral sign, v(x), and dx, but we need to find the numerical value. </p>

    <p>In calculus, if the derivative of f(x) is v(x), then the area under the v(x) curve is f(x) minus f(0).  For instance, to find the area up to x=4, we need to find an "antiderivative" of v(x). </p>

    <p>An antiderivative is a function whose derivative is the original function. Finding it requires working backward from differentiation rules. The quick formula for the antiderivative of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1). </p>

    <p>The key to integrals is to work backward from derivatives and adjust. For example, if we need the antiderivative of x^(1/2), we would raise the exponent to x^(3/2). To cancel any unwanted factors that arise from differentiation, we introduce a constant, like 2/3. </p>
