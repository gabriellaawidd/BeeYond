    <p>A limit is the value a function approaches as the input value gets closer to a specified quantity. Limits are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals. This handout focuses on determining limits analytically and determining limits by looking at a graph. </p>

    <h2>Determining a Limit Analytically</h2>
    <p>There are many methods to determine a limit analytically, and they are usually used in succession. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, see if the limit can be evaluated by direct substitution. </li>
        <li>Second, if direct substitution yields an undefined result, factor and reduce the fraction or multiply by the conjugate. </li>
        <li>Third, if the second method does not work, find the left and right sided limits. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Evaluate by Direct Substitution: Take the value of the limit and evaluate the function at this value. There are two situations where direct substitution will be used, direct substitution with a numerical value and direct substitution with infinity. </p>

    <h3>Example 1: Limits at a Numerical Value.</h3>
    <p>Let's consider the example: lim(x--2) (sqrt(2x^3 + 9) + 3x - 1) / (4x + 1) =</p>
    <p>By direct substitution:</p>
    <p>(sqrt(2(2)^3 + 9) + 3(2) - 1) / (4(2) + 1) = (sqrt(25) + 5) / 9 = 10 / 9</p>
    <p>This demonstrates evaluating a limit by direct substitution when it yields a defined result.</p>
