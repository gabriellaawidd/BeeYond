    <h2>Chapter 2: Differential Calculus</h2>
    <p>In this chapter, it is assumed that all linear spaces and flat spaces under consideration are finite-dimensional. </p>

    <h3>Differentiation of Processes</h3>
    <p>A mapping p from some interval I (a subset of real numbers) to a flat space E will be called a process.  It is useful to think of the value p(t) in E as describing the state of some physical system at time t.  In special cases, the mapping p describes the motion of a particle, where p(t) is the place of the particle at time t. </p>

    <h4>Definition of Differentiability</h4>
    <p>A process p from interval I to flat space E is said to be differentiable at a point t within I if a certain limit exists.  This limit is defined as (1/s) multiplied by the difference between p(t+s) and p(t), as s approaches 0.  </p>
    <p>The value of this limit is then called the derivative of p at t.  A process p is considered differentiable if it is differentiable at every point t within I.  In this case, the mapping that assigns the derivative at each point is itself called the derivative of p. </p>

    <h4>Higher-Order Derivatives</h4>
    <p>For a given positive integer n, a process p is said to be n times differentiable if its n-th derivative can be defined recursively.  The first derivative is denoted as ∂p, and subsequent derivatives are found by differentiating the previous derivative.  </p>
    <p>A process p is categorized as being of class C^n if it is n times differentiable and its n-th derivative is continuous.  If a process p is of class C^n for all positive integers n, it is considered to be of class C^∞. </p>
